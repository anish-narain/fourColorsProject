If you find that CATIA V5-6R2019 GA Installation crashes out immediately when the setup.exe application is launched, this is due to the presence of a bug in the original installation launcher. Replace the existing setup.exe file with the file attached and re-run the installation.


Download the replacement file attached here.
Extract the ZIP file:

Right click and select ‘Cut’ (or copy). Alternatively, you can drag and drop into the installation media directory.
“Paste’ or drop the file in the CATIA R2019 installation media directory. This will replace the old ‘setup.exe’.
This should then allow you to ‘Run’ the setup.exe file and continue with the installation.
