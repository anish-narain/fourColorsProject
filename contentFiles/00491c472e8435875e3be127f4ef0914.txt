The MAC Address, also known as the Physical Address, of a computer is derived from a network adaptor. 


Background
Most machines today have multiple network adapters; Ethernet (LAN), Wireless & Bluetooth. All three will have their own MAC address to identify them which is unique for that single physical product. Some servers may also host multiple Ethernet adapters for performance and/or redundancy. Some licences require the MAC address in order to create a licence based on a unique reference. This is the case for FLEX LM (NET) licences.
