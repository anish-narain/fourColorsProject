What is software licensing?
A software licence is a legal entity which gives the user the ability to either use and/or redistribute particular software. The majority of software licenses come in the form of a string of either letters, numbers or both, typically unique for a particular user or group of users. Some software can also be licensed using a licence file for particular operating systems.
What does a software license mean to me?
Dassault Systèmes’ software is licensed using a license file. The file itself governs how many users are allowed to use the software and/or what features of the software are available. At TECHNIA, the majority of our customers will either be supplied a licence for IBM Licence User Management (LUM) console, Dassault Systèmes Licence Server (DSLS) console and or Flex Licence Management console.
